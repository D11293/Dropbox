<h1>Master the Admin Console</h1>

<h1>Understanding the Admin Console</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_master_admin.PNG"></center>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of each section within your Admin Console:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dashboard - Gather key insights on your team's activities, access shortcuts to important admin actions, and quickly find members to manage their accounts.</li>
	<li>Members - Add/delete team members, monitor their activity and take quick actions (e.g., reset passwords or add another member as an admin).</li>
	<li>Activity - Monitor your entire team by viewing specific events or creating full reports across specific dates. You can get more detailed info by clicking on a team member's name.</li>
	<li>Authentication - Set up single sign-on to let your team members log in using their corporate credentials, or add an extra layer of security by encouraging team members to use two-step verification.</li>
	<li>Sharing - Decide whether new shared folders and new shared links are "team only" or accessible to non-team members, too.</li>
	<li>Team folder - Use a team folder to automatically share with your entire team. Only admins can create or delete a team folder.</li>
	<li>Account - Add more licenses to your plan, view your current plan, update billing information, and review billing history.</li>
	<li>Help - Get access to our self-service resources like our Help Center and this guide, or contact your account team for additional help.</li>
</ul>
