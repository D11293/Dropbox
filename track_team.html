<h1>Track team activity</h1>
<p><em>Get visibility and insight into what's happening across your Business account.</em></p>
<p>You can get a bird's-eye view of your team's activity from the Activity tab of the Admin Console. This includes login activity, password changes, recent sharing activity, and newly linked devices.</p>

<h1>Overseeing team activity</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_Learn_about.PNG"></center>
<p>Each line of the activity log shows the name of the member taking the action, the IP address of the device where the action originated, and the general time when the action occurred.</p>
<p>Use the drop-down menu to filter the list by a specific type of activity (such as password changes).</p>
<p>The Activity log records:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing: Someone participates in a sharing event, such as sending out a link to a file or joining a folder.</li>
	<li>Passwords: A team member changes their password or two-step verification settings.</li>
	<li>Logins: A team member signs in or fails to sign in to the Dropbox website.</li>
	<li>Admin actions: You or another admin changes settings in the Admin Console, such as shared folder permissions.</li>
	<li>Apps: A team member links a third-party app to their Dropbox account.</li>
	<li>Devices: A team member links a computer or mobile device to their Dropbox account.</li>
	<li>Membership: Someone joins the team or is removed from the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The Activity page does not include file and folder events, such as edits or deletions. You can view a running history of changes to your files (including shared folders that you belong to) on your Events page.</p>

<p>The Events tab on the Dropbox website gives you a timeline of all changes made to files within your Dropbox folder, including edits, deletions, name and location changes. You can only see changes to your own files that are part of shared folders you belong to.</p>
<p>To reverse a change or restore deleted files, just click on the highlighted text of any event.</p>

	<p>Clicking on file and folder names will direct you to the file or folder within your Dropbox.</p>
