<h1>Sharing at a glance</h1>
<p><em>Learn more about the three sharing methods available to Dropbox for Business admins.</em></p>
<p>Every team has a unique workflow, so we offer three ways to share files and folders. Read these quick snapshots about each sharing method and then check out the other articles in this category for more details.</p>

<h1>Share a folder</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_sharing.PNG"></center>
<p>Creating a shared folder is like creating a shared workspace for your team for a given project. When someone joins a shared folder, it appears inside their Dropbox and automatically syncs to all their linked devices. All of your team's project files will be in one central place for folders members to easily access, edit, and save.</p>

<p>Dropbox for Business users can also set permissions on whether shared folder members can edit or just view a folders contents. In addition, admins can control if folders can be shared with users outside your Business account.</p>

<h1>Send a link</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_sharing.PNG"></center>
<p>Links are great for sending copies of your work to clients and team members. This method is great for broadcast-style sending rather than collaboration, because if the recipient makes changes to the file after downloading it, the changes won't be reflected in your version. Your clients can view or download the latest version in seconds, even if they don't have a Dropbox account.</p>

<p>Dropbox for Business users can set passwords and expiration dates on shared links to protect sensitive data. In addition, admins can limit access to links to only people on the Business account.</p>

<h1>Team folders</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_invite_team.PNG"></center>
<p>Team folders are a special type of shared folder that only Admins can create. They automatically appear in every member's Dropbox, making onboarding large groups easy.</p>
<p>Keep in mind everything inside a team folder is shared with the entire team, and they're only available to team members. If you need to invite non-team members, or if you only want to invite a few people, use a shared folder instead.</p>
<p>To create a new team folder, just go to the Team folder tab inside the Admin Console.</p>
