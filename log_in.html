<h1>Log in with single sign-on</h1>
<p><em>If your administrator has set up "single sign-on" or Active Directory, you'll be able to access Dropbox using the same login credentials you use for other work applications.</em></p>
<p>To get set up, it's best to check with your admin first. Each business will have its own requirements for its employees.</p>
<p>Admins can make single sign-on mandatory or optional. If your admin has made single sign-on optional, you'll be able to use sign-in with your normal Dropbox password, or just leave the password field blank to get redirected to your company's sign-in page - it's entirely up to you!</p>
