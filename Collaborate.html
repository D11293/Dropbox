<h1>Collaborate with shared folders</h1>
<p><em>Use a shared folder to create a central space for your team to collaborate on files.</em></p>
<p>All folders in Dropbox are private by default, but you can make any normal folder a shared folder. When you share a folder, its contents will only be available to Dropbox users you specifically invite. Once a user accepts your invitation, the shared folder appears in their Dropbox, just like it does in yours.</p>
<h1>Key points:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Shared folders are the best way to collaborate using Dropbox.</li>
<li>Members of a shared folder can edit and access the same files.</li>
<li>You can assign some members full edit rights and others view-only access to prevent them from adding, editing, or removing files.</li>
<li>You can also set access controls to determine if users outside your Dropbox for Business team are allowed to join your shared folder.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h1>Setting access permissions</h1>
	<center><img src="images/image5_collaborate.PNG"></center>
<p>There are three roles in a shared folder:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Owner</strong> can change view/edit permissions, invite additional people, and transfer ownership to someone else. This is the default role for whoever initially shares a folder.</li>
		<li><strong>Editor</strong> can add/edit/delete files in the folder just like an owner. If the owner allows it, editors can also invite people to the folder, remove other members from the 	folder, and set the roles of other members. Editor is the default setting for the people you invite.</li>
		<li><strong>Viewer</strong> is the most limited role and can't add/edit/delete files in the folder. A viewer will be able to tell that they have view-only permissions because of the lock icon that appears on the shared folder:<img src="images/lock.PNG"></li>
	</ul>
<h1>To invite viewers to a shared folder:</h1>

<h1>Changing sharing settings as the folder owner</h1>
<center><img src="images/image7_collaborate.PNG"></center>
<p>If you're the owner of the shared folder, you can decide if other members can invite users to your folder, and if they can change other users' access permissions.</p>
<p>In addition, Business users can decide to make shared folders "team only" - a helpful tool for folders containing sensitive material. When enabled, this permission setting prevents external users from being invited to join a folder.</p>
<h1>To adjust a shared folder's sharing settings:</h1>
<center><img src="images/image8_collaborate.PNG"></center>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to the Dropbox website (if you haven't already).</li>
	<li>Right-click (or control click on a Mac) on the shared folder you want to change. A new window will appear.</li>
	<li>Click the Change sharing settings link at the top of the window.</li>
	<li>Select who can be invited and who can change permissions.</li>
</ol>
