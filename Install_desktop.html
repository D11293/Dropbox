<h1>Install the desktop app</h1>
<p><em>The Dropbox desktop application lets you access all your most important files any time from your computer, even ones that were originally created on another device.</em></p>
<p>Installing our application on your computer creates a special folder, the Dropbox folder. This folder has unique properties: it automatically updates your files so they're the same across all your devices with Dropbox installed. No more USB drives, emailing work to yourself, or manually uploading and downloading files - it just works.</p>
<p>Use the Dropbox folder like you would any other folder on your computer. Anything you save into the folder will be available on your other devices and backed up on our website.</p>
<p>After the desktop application is installed, you can easily access your Dropbox folder by clicking the small blue Dropbox icon in your computer's system tray or menu bar. (If you're on a PC, it's in the lower right-hand corner, and if you're on a Mac, it's in the upper right-hand corner.)</p>
