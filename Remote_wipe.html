<h1>Remote wipe</h1>
<p><em>Remote wipe lets you delete the work Dropbox from a team member's linked devices.</em></p>
<p>Remote wipe puts you in charge of company data, perfect for lost devices or when removing a team member.</p>
<p>Once you unlink a device and select the remote wipe option, the device will immediately stop syncing. Dropbox will attempt to delete the entire work Dropbox once the device is online and the Dropbox application is running. Dropbox is always remote wiped when you unlink mobile devices.</p>

<p>If a team member loses a device you can make sure their data doesn't wind up in the wrong hands. You can remote wipe a member's work Dropbox, but not their personal Dropbox.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to Dropbox with your admin account.</li>
	<li>Click on the Admin Console in the left sidebar.</li>
	<li>Choose the name of the member whose device you want to unlink.</li>
	<li>Select the device you want to unlink under Devices and click the X next to it.</li>
	<li>In the pop-up window, select the option to delete the work Dropbox from the computer the next time it comes online and then click Unlink.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Checking the status of a remote wipe</h1>
<center><img src="images/image4_track_team.PNG"></center>
<p>Dropbox displays the Delete status for each device you've chosen to remote wipe. Here are the status indicators you might see:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pending: The device has not come back online and/or the Dropbox application is not running. Until both of these conditions are met, Dropbox will not be able to delete the folder.</li>
	<li>In progress: Dropbox has connected with the device, and the folder is currently in the process of being deleted.</li>
	<li>Succeeded: The entire Dropbox was deleted from the device.</li>
	<li>Failed: If Dropbox was unable to delete any file within Dropbox, we'll provide a report that includes the name of each file that couldn't be deleted and the error for why. Click on the errors link to get a pop-up window and select Download report to view the report.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check the status of a remote wipe:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to Dropbox with your admin account.</li>
	<li>Click on the Admin Console in the left sidebar.</li>
	<li>Click on the member's name on the Members tab. Or, if you deleted the user's account from the team and chose the remote wipe option, click on the Deleted members tab and click on the user's name.</li>
	<li>In the Delete in progress section, find the device and its Device status.</li>
</ol>
