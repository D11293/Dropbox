			<h1>Configure sharing settings</h1>
			<p><em>Set default sharing permissions for your entire team from within 	the Admin Console.</em></p>
			<p>If your team works on lots of sensitive materials, you can set 	default rules about whether or not team members can share work outside 	the team. These rules will apply to everyone on your 	Business 		account.</p>
			<h1>Key Points:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>These rules will apply to everyone on your Business account</li>
				<li>If you allow folder sharing with people outside the team, your 	team can still designate individual folders as team-only.</li>
				<li>If you allow link sharing with people outside the team, you can 	still control the default settings on new shared links.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To manage team-wide sharing permissions, just follow these steps:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Sign in to Dropbox with your admin account and click on Admin 	Console in the left-hand sidebar.</li>
				<li>Click on the Sharing tab on the left-hand side of the page and 	then answer the following questions:</li>
				<li>Under "Shared folder settings," answer Yes or No to the 	following questions:
					<ul>
						<li>Allow people on my team to share folders outside of [	your team's name]?</li>
						<li>Allow people on my team to join shared folders outside 	of [your team's name]? These folders aren't subject to your team settings.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Under "Shared link settings," answer Yes or No to the following question:
					<ul>
						<li>Allow people on my team to share links with people 	outside of [your team's name]?</li>
						<li>If yes, choose the default access level for new shared 	links: will newly created links be accessible by anyone with the link unless manually changed, or the other way around?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
