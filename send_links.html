<h1>Send links to your work</h1>
<p><em>Quickly share a copy of your work with others, even if they don't have a Dropbox account.</em></p>
<p>Shared links are perfect for sending work to external partners or even other people on your team. They're like email attachments, but simpler and without the file-size limit.</p>
<h1>Key points:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Recipients don't need a Dropbox account and they'll get an instant preview of the linked file or folder through their browser.</li>
<li>You can even give your links passwords and expiration dates to control who's able to access them.</li>
<li>Links are dynamic, which means that whenever they're accessed online they link to the most current version of your file or folder. No need to keep re-sending links as you update your work!</li>
<li>They can still download and edit a copy of the files you share, but they never access or edit your original work.</li>
</ul>
