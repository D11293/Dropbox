<h1>Download the mobile app</h1>
<p><em>Access your files on the go from your smartphone or tablet.</em></p>
<p>Our app for iOS and Android is a great way to get even more out of Dropbox, letting you preview and share files right from your smartphone or tablet. The mobile app only downloads files when you need access, so it never hogs your data plan or storage.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure an important file is always available - even if you don't have an Internet connection - mark it as a Favorite by tapping the star icon. The file will be added to the Favorites tab, saved to your device for offline viewing, and updated whenever you have an Internet connection.</p>
