<h1>Encourage two-step verification</h1>
<p><em>Encourage your team members to add an extra layer of protection to their accounts by using two-step verification.</em></p>
<p>Two-step verification is an optional but highly recommended security feature. In addition to their username and password, two-step verification requires users to sign into Dropbox with a six-digit security code available only from their mobile phone.</p>
<p>You can require that two-step verification stays on once your team members enable it. If a team member loses their phone and is unable to access the required code to sign in, you can turn off the security feature in the Admin Console.</p>

<h1>Reminding your team to turn on two-step verification</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_invite_team.PNG"></center>
<p>You cannot enable two-step verification on behalf of your team members because it requires access to their mobile phones. You can check whether or not your team members have activated two-step verification, and also send them reminders to set up this security feature.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to the Dropbox website using your Business admin account.</li>
	<li>Click on Admin Console in the left-hand sidebar.</li>
	<li>Click on Authentication in the sidebar.</li>
	<li>In the "Two-step verification" section, click Send a reminder to team members who still have it disabled.</li>
</ol>
