<h1>Sharing overview</h1>
<p><em>Dropbox provides two ways for your team to share files and folders.</em></p>
<p>No matter how you get work done, Dropbox has you covered with shared folders and links. Each method has its own distinct advantages, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Here's some information to help you choose the best way to share.</p>
<p>Once you've decided on the best method to share, check out the Share a folder and Send a link articles in this section to get started.</p>

<h1>Went to share a folder</h1>

<p>Shared folders are perfect for teams collaborating on the same files. For example, say several team members need to make edits to the same presentation, or your accounting team needs to update the same spreadsheets. Rather than managing multiple versions of your files and emailing attachments back and forth, share a folder instead!</p>

<p>When you share a folder with your colleagues, it feels like you're sharing a computer. All of your project files will be in one central place (the shared folder) and any member of the folder can save changes directly to the shared copy in an instant. It's like creating a shared workspace for your team for a given project.</p>

<p>Dropbox for Business users also have the option to choose whether collaborators can edit files in the shared folder, or only view them. For example, a sales team can use view-only permissions to make sure their reps always have the most up-to-date versions of sales materials, while ensuring that only certain managers can actually update or change those files.</p>

<p>In addition, Business users can decide to make shared folders "team only" - a helpful tool for folders containing sensitive material. When enabled, this permission setting prevents external users from being invited to join a folder.</p>

<h1>When to send a link</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_sharing.PNG"></center>
<p>Shared links are great for sending copies of your work to clients and team members. You can link to files and folders of any size. Instead of trying to zip and send them as an email attachments, use shared links instead!</p>

<p>With a Dropbox link, your clients can view or download the latest version in seconds, even if they don't have a Dropbox account. And you don't need to worry about re-sending the file if you notice a typo: just update your file and the latest version is available at the original link, automatically.</p>

<p>Because links work for both files and folders, you can send a whole set of documents or just one file. This method is great for broadcast-style sending rather than collaboration, because if the recipient makes changes to the file after downloading it, the changes won't be reflected in your version. For example, conference organizers can send attendees a shared link to a folder that contains event materials.</p>

<p>Dropbox for Business users also get an additional layer of control on shared links, with the option to add password protection and expirations.</p>
