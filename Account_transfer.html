<h1>Account transfer</h1>
<p><em>Minimize interruptions to your team's workflow by transferring a deleted user's work Dropbox folder to another team member.</em></p>
<p>When someone leaves your Dropbox for Business team, you can immediately transfer their account to another team member, or wait and transfer the data later on.</p>
<p>All the folders and files in the deleted member's work Dropbox will go to the recipient of your choice. Dropbox will try to preserve sharing relationships, so if the member owned a shared folder, Dropbox will transfer ownership of the folder to the recipient.</p>
