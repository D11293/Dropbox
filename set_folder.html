<h1>Set folder permissions</h1>
<p><em>Shared folders are at the heart of collaboration in Dropbox, so take some time to familiarize yourself with how they work.</em></p>
<p>As an admin, your job is to make sure the right people have access to the right files. Since access to files is determined on a per-folder basis, you can rest assured that team members are only seeing the files they need to, and nothing else.</p>
<p>This article is meant to give you a quick overview of how folder permissions work in Dropbox for Business, but if you want to learn more about shared folders, make sure to read the Collaborate with shared folders article in the Dropbox for Business User Guide.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Understanding the default setting: all folders are private</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_organize.PNG"></center>
<p>Each team member (including admins) has his or her own private work space in Dropbox. Everything stored in Dropbox is private by default, so you can rest assured that others can only access the files you choose to share with them.</p>

When work is ready, members can invite collaborators to shared folders, or they can send copies of their work to other people by using shared links.

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Admins cannot see inside team members' Dropbox folders while they're members of the Business account. However, the company owns all accounts connected to a Dropbox for Business account, and when members are deleted from the account admins can use our account transfer feature to access shared and unshared materials.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Shared folder permissions</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_set_folder.PNG"></center>
<p>Anyone on your team can create a shared folder. They're created by sending invitations to a Dropbox user's email address. Once a user accepts the invitation, the shared folder appears inside their Dropbox folder and its contents automatically sync to their linked computers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Admins, like any member of a Dropbox for Business team, can only access folders to which they have been invited.</p>
<p>There are three roles in a shared folder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Owner can change view/edit permissions, invite additional people, and transfer ownership to someone else. This is the default role for whoever initially shares a folder.</li>
	<li>Editor can add/edit/delete files in the folder just like an owner. If the owner allows it, editors can also invite people to the folder, remove other members from the folder, and change the roles of other members. Editor is the default setting for the people you invite.</li>
	<li>Viewer is the most limited role and can't add/edit/delete files in the folder. A viewer will be able to tell that they have view-only permissions because of the lock icon that appears on the shared folder: <img src="images/lock.png"></li>
</ul>

<h1>Restricting outside access to your team's folders</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_Check_Out.PNG"></center>
<p>As an admin, you can decide team-wide sharing settings like whether members can share folders with non-team members, or if they can join folders created by users outside the team.</p>
<p>To adjust these settings:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to Dropbox with your admin account and click on the Admin Console in the left-hand sidebar.</li>
	<li>Click on the Sharing tab on the left-hand side of the page.</li>
	<li>Answer Yes or No to the questions under the "Shared folder settings" section.</li>
</ol>
<center><img src="images/image2_set_folder.PNG"></center>
<p>However, if you allow your team the flexibility to share folders outside the team, they can still make individual shared folders "team only" as needed. That way, your team can share with partners that aren't on your team, but still restrict access to sensitive folders on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h1>Monitoring shared folders</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_Learn_about.PNG"></center>
<p>While admins can only access folders to which they've been invited, they can monitor sharing activity using the sharing audit log.</p>
<p>The sharing audit log lets you track how data is shared inside and outside your company. Dropbox records all internal and external sharing actions, including shared folder creation and changes made to shared folder permissions.</p>
<p>Shared folder events are recorded when someone:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creates a shared folder</li>
	<li>Invites a person to a folder</li>
	<li>Joins a folder</li>
	<li>Removes a person from a folder</li>
	<li>Changes the role of another person in a folder (from an "editor" to a "viewer," for example)</li>
	<li>Transfers ownership of a folder to another person</li>
	<li>Unshares a folder</li>
	<li>Changes the sharing permissions on a folder</li>
	<li>Changes the general sharing permissions for shared folders in the Admin Console</li>
	<li>Changes the sharing permissions on a folder</li>
	<li>Moves a shared folder from a work Dropbox to a personal Dropbox (or vice versa), specifically when both folder level settings and team-wide settings permit sharing outside the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>To monitor sharing activity:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to Dropbox with your admin account and click on Admin Console in the left-hand sidebar.</li>
	<li>Click on the Activity tab on the left-hand side of the page.</li>
	<li>Click on the drop-down menu at the top of the page and select Sharing.</li>
</ol>
<center><img src="images/image3_Set_folder.PNG"></center>
<p>The sharing log keeps track of every sharing action across your Dropbox for Business account. The view on the Admin Console does not display every event, but you can create a full sharing report if you need more detailed information.</p>
