<h1>Invite your team</h1>
<p><em>Have team members join your Business account.</em></p>
<p>Invited members will create accounts that draw from your team's shared storage and give you more control and oversight over how they share work files.</p>
<p>You can send invitations to users who still need to create a Dropbox account, or to those who already have one!</p>

<h1>Inviting members to your team</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_invite_team.PNG"></center>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to your admin-linked Dropbox account.</li>
	<li>Click on the Admin Console in the left sidebar.</li>
	<li>On the Members page, click the Invite members button in the top right-hand corner.</li>
	<li>Enter the email addresses of the team members you'd like to invite and add an optional message.</li>
	<li>Click Invite to team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Team members will get an email from us inviting them to join your team. When they accept the invite, we automatically detect if they have an existing account linked to their email address:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If they don't have an account linked to the email address you sent the invite to, they'll simply create one. You can see what the process looks like here.</li>
	<li>If they do have an account linked to that email, they'll choose whether to migrate their stuff to their newly-created Business account or move all their stuff to a personal Dropbox. You can see what the process looks like here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Everyone's work will remain private by default. All files and folders must be deliberately shared. Admins can't see inside a team member's Dropbox while they're a member of the team.</p>

<h1>Adding admin permissions</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_invite_team.PNG"></center>
<p>Now that you've invited your team, some members might need admin privileges, especially if they need to access billing information or invite other users to the account.</p>
<p>Plus, it never hurts to have an extra admin just in case you're on vacation.</p>
<p>To add admin permissions to a team member:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to your admin linked Dropbox account.</li>
	<li>Click on the Admin Console in the left sidebar.</li>
	<li>On the Members page, click the gear icon to the right of a team member's email address.</li>
	<li>Select Add admin permissions.</li>
</ol>
