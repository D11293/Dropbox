<h1>Set up your folders</h1>
<p><em>Setting up an initial folder structure makes onboarding and file management easy.</em></p>
<p>Creating structure for your team's work ensures you have access to important shared folders, which may come in handy if you need to restore deleted files or manage access.</p>

<h1>Sharing folders</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_set_up.PNG"></center>
<p>Access to your team's work is determined on a per-folder basis. All folders default to private, and you'll need to invite users to access shared folders. If a folder isn't shared with someone, they won't know it exists.</p>
<p>You can create a shared folder and invite team members. Once they accept your invitation, any files you add or modify in this folder will automatically sync and update for all other members - and vice versa. For example, you can create an "Accounting" folder, invite the members from your accounting team, and then start adding and changing files. Everyone will always be on the same page.</p>
<p>To create a shared folder:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sign in to the Dropbox website.</li>
	<li>Click the "Share a folder..." icon in the right-hand corner: <img src="images/2_1_2_B_RainbowFolder.png"></li>
	<li>Choose to either share an existing folder or create a new one.</li>
	<li>Choose the folder you want to share or name the folder you want to create.</li>
	<li>Add the email addresses of the users you want to collaborate with in your shared folder, and add a personal message to them if you'd like.</li>
	<li>Click Share folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also create team folders, which are special shared folders only admins can create. Team folders automatically appear in every member's Dropbox, making onboarding large groups a snap. Keep in mind everything inside a team folder is shared with the entire team. They're only available to team members, so external members cannot be invited. If you need to invite non-team members, use a shared folder instead.</p>
<p>To create a new team folder, just go to the Team folder tab inside the Admin Console.</p>

<h1>Organizing by team</h1>
<center><img src="images/image3_set_up.PNG"></center>
<p>Organize your folders by department, so team members only see the documents related to their work.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Organizing by project or client</h1>
<center><img src="images/image4_set_up.PNG"></center>
<p>Creating a shared folder for each project or client lets team members coordinate with specific members without worrying about giving the wrong person access.</p>
