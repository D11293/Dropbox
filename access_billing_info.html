<h1>Access billing information</h1>
<p><em>The Account tab in the Admin Console is the central place for all your billing needs.</em></p>
<p>Everything related to your Dropbox for Business account is managed via the Admin Console, including your team's billing information. You can check your renewal date, update your billing information, and get an invoice all from the same location.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Checking your team's renewal date</h1>
<p>You can find your renewal date by going to the Account tab.</p>
<p>Your Business account will auto-renew each year or month (depending on your billing cycle). For annual accounts, we'll give admins a heads-up 30 days before the renewal date.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Updating your billing information</h1>
<p>You can view and change your billing information by going to the Billing tab within the Account section of the Admin Console.</p>
<p>Credit card details are tied to the admin who placed the last transaction. If you're another admin on the team and ready to make a purchase, you'll be required to enter new billing information.</p>
<div class="separation"></div>
<h1>Getting invoices</h1>
<p>If you paid by credit card and need a receipt or invoice for your Dropbox for Business account,</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the Admin Console, go to the Account tab.</li>
	<li>Click on the Billing tab.</li>
	<li>Under the Billing history section, you'll see a list of all transactions related to your account.</li>
	<li>Find the transaction for which you need a receipt and click the "Receipt" link. You'll be taken to a PDF receipt that you can print or save for your records.</li>
