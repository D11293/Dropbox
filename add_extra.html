<h1>Add an extra layer of security</h1>
<p><em>Protect your account with two-step verification, an optional but highly recommended security feature.</em></p>
<p>Once two-step verification is enabled, Dropbox will require you to enter a six-digit security code in addition to your password when you sign into the Dropbox website or link a new device.</p>

<h1>Enabling two-step verification</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_add_extra.PNG"></center>
<p>Before enabling two-step verification, you'll receive a special 16-digit backup code. It is very important that you write this key down and store it somewhere safe. If you ever lose your phone, or can't receive or generate a security code, you'll need this backup code for emergency access to your Dropbox.</p>
<p>To enable two-step verification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the Dropbox website.</li>
<li>Click the Show deleted files icon (the trash can) in the top right corner.</li>
<li>All your deleted files will show up in grey.</li>
<li>Select the file(s) you want to recover, and click the Restore button at the top of the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>To restore a group of files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the Dropbox website.</li>
<li>Click on your name in the upper-right of any page to open your account menu.</li>
<li>Click Settings from the account menu and select the Security tab.</li>
<li>Select Enable under Two-step verification.</li>
<li>Click Get started.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Choosing your authentication method</h1>
<center><img src="images/image2_add_extra.PNG"></center>
<p>You'll need a mobile phone to access your six-digit security code. You can either have the code texted to you, or you can download an app that automatically generates a code for you.</p>
<p><em>Use text messages:</em></p>
<p>If you choose to receive your security codes by text message, you'll need a phone capable of receiving text messages (carrier rates may apply). Whenever you successfully sign in to Dropbox using your password, a text message containing a security code will be sent to your phone. To enable this option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Use text messages during the two-step verification setup.</li>
<li>Enter the phone number where you'd like to receive text messages.</li>
<center><img src="images/image3_add_extra.PNG"></center>
<li>You'll be sent a security code by text message. Verify your phone number and enable two-step verification by entering this code on the website when prompted.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Use a mobile app:</em></p>
<p>Several mobile apps are available that will generate a unique time-sensitive security code you can use for two-step verification purposes. Any app that supports the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) protocol should work, including the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Google Authenticator (Android/iPhone/Blackberry)</li>
	<li>Duo Mobile (Android/iPhone)</li>
	<li>Amazon AWS MFA (Android)</li>
	<li>Authenticator (Windows Phone 7)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most apps will generate security codes even when cellular/data service is not available - useful when traveling or where coverage is unreliable.</p>
<p>To use one of these apps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select Use a mobile app during the two-step verification setup.</li>
	<li>Choose to either scan the barcode (if your app supports it) or click enter your secret key manually to be given a secret key you can type into the app.</li>
	<center><img src="images/image4_add_extra.PNG"></center>
	<li>Once your app is configured, enter the security code generated by your authenticator app to verify setup and enable two-step verification.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When setting up two-step verification, consider adding a second phone number that can receive text messages as well. If you ever lose your primary phone, you'll be able to receive a backup security code at your secondary number instead.</p>
