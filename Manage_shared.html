<h1>Understanding shared links</h1>
<center><img src="images/image1_manage_shared.PNG"></center>
<p>Anyone on your team can create shared links to files or folders within their Dropbox. Shared links are similar to email attachments, but are more versatile.</p>

<p>Here are a few important things to remember about shared links:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They're dynamic, which means whenever they're accessed online they link to the most current version of your file or folder.</li>
	<li>They have no file-size limit, so they can attach to really large files, or even entire folders.</li>
	<li>They can be given passwords and/or expiration dates.</li>
	<li>Access to a link can be restricted to team members only.</li>
</ul>

<p>All Dropbox for Business users have a few ways to restrict access to the shared links they create:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They can limit who can see the link by restricting access to team members only or by giving the link a password.</li>
	<li>They can add an expiration date to the link so access will be removed after a certain period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an admin, you can set team-wide access settings for newly shared links from within the Admin Console:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can decide whether members of your account can share links with people outside your Dropbox for Business account.</li>
	<li>If you allow external sharing, you can also specify the default privacy setting for new links.</li>
</ul>
